    //*I am trying to understand the waaterloo problem since it might be a good problem for coding competitions.

    //*For problem 2:
    //*Both the number of horizontal tiles and vertical tiles has to be even. 

    //*Problem 3 generalizes problem 2.

    //*In the proving sequence, it kind of seems like we broke problem down into smaller pieces: DP?
    //*Can definitely make a DP kind of solution for this. 
    //*People could either store in vector or if they notice of fibonacci they can store in 2 values. 

    //*Problem 4: Even for 3xn, we run into the fibonacci sequence. 
    
    //*Sometimes as long as we know the last x numbers, we can find. Store in memory but swapping sure will take time. 

    //*Problem 5 is even more general. 
    //*n can only be even because area must fit in. 
    //*But the explanation here might be specific to 3 by n rectangles. 
    //*I don't think I will be able to explain to the point of the video.
    //*No way I can explain this in editorial.
