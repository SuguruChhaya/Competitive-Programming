and for prefix sum array
the example could be
OOOX
OOOX
XOOO
XOOO
and the prefix sum arryay for row is
0001
0001
1111
1111
and for col is :
0001
0002
1002
2002
so instead of searching through  a lot of points on the graph to see whether the movement can be made
you can just get the answer by observing the change in numbers on the two prefix sum arrays
